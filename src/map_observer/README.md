Map Observer is a "Quality of Life" mod intended for players who want to see
more of the map on their screen without compromises such as the simplified view
called "Map Overview". This mod has a few settings, but no additional
configuration is required to zoom out just a bit more.

## Features

-   Zoom out further before the Map Overview turns on
-   Customize basic map colors in both map modes
-   Manually switch between Regular View and Map Overview (setting)
-   Adjust zoom level limits in the configuration file

## Configuration

Most of the settings can be changed in the game if [Mod Extras][mod_extras] is
installed. However, the zoom levels have to be modified manually in the
configuration file. Location of the Map Observer configuration file for each
platform is listed below.

**Please quit shapez before editing the configuration file. This ensures it
won't get overwritten.**
