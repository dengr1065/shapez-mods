**Rate Changer** lets you modify the tick rate (simulation accuracy) on-the-fly
without having to open settings and reload the savegame. This can be used to
test your factories with different simulation rates, have a lower tick rate
while the game runs in background or avoid lag when building wires layer
circuits and placing large amounts of buildings with lower visual trade-offs.
