Building Tweaks is a mod to improve your productivity by changing how the user
interface works. You can enable or disable tweaks in the settings file provided
by the game. Currently there are two "tweaks" available:

## Belt Planner follows Multiplace setting

If you enable Multiplace in the game settings, meaning of the belt planner key
will be inverted: When Shift (by default) is held, belt (and wire) planner will
be temporarily disabled, otherwise it stays enabled. Because such behavior may
be uncomfortable for some people, this tweak is turned off by default.

## Keep selected building in Map Overview

By default when you zoom out far enough, you will enter Map Overview mode and
the currently selected building will be discarded. This tweak allows you to keep
the selected building even after entering and returning from the Map Overview.

## Cycle buildings in active toolbar

If this is enabled, behavior of Cycle Buildings key (Tab by default) will be
changed to find the next building in active toolbar instead of returning to the
primary one.
